I'm a Software Engineer with a strong focus on Deep Learning. I completed my Master's in Computer Science, Intelligent Systems at [Technical University Berlin](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de), while working as a research assistant at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en.html). In my thesis, I explored a novel method to achieve general prediction stability of convolutional neural networks across various input distortions. Previously, I worked on relation extraction from open social media data at [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web). During my studies, I also worked at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) and as a freelancer for different clients, where I developed, migrated, and maintained various machine learning compontents. I'm interested in applying machine learning to solve meaningful problems.
